# Nim Days

[Nim days](https://github.com/xmonader/nimdays) book is about my journey using Nim and creating useful/practical things with it including:

- ini parser
- bencode parser
- links checker
- tictactoe (commandline and gui) 
- testing framework
- build system
- tcp router
- redis parser
- redis client
- assets bundler 
- terminal table
- dotfiles manager
- urlshortening application

This book is influenced by the great books [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/), [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org) and I'm planning to follow the same model of having the book available for free online.
